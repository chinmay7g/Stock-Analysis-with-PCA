# Stock-Analysis-with-PCA

Principal Component Analysis is used to reduce dimensionality of voluminous data by sorting the variance and their importance in a descending manner with their principal components. Stock Market Data such as the returns of the S&P500 when sorted according to their principal components help explain better the trend and analysis within the stock returns.

In this project, the first principal component that relates the market return factor is used to replicate the returns of the S&P500 ETF. 

A simulated portfolio using the first principal component is constructed and as seen it converges over with the ETF over time.
